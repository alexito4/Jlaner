======

Jlaner is a Mac app that allows you to convert **json** to a *literal* accepted by other languages.

> [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)): In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects.
